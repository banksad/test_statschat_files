Main points

    Households with fewer people (one or two person households) were more likely to own their accommodation outright, compared with larger household sizes.

    Lone parent households had the highest percentages in the social rented sector (37.8% in England and 35.6% in Wales), compared with other family compositions, and those with dependent children had higher levels than those without.

    Households where all residents identified within the "Black, Black British, Black Welsh, Caribbean or African" high-level ethnic group category were the least likely to own their accommodation (27.7% in England and 20.5% in Wales), compared with other household ethnic group combinations.

    Households where all residents who answered the religion question identified as "Muslim" had the highest percentages that rented their accommodation (58.5% in England and 62.4% in Wales) and in the social rented sector (27.8% in England and 24.0% in Wales), compared with other household religion combinations.

    Households with some residents aged 65 years and over were 4.4 times more likely to own outright in England (69.4%), and 3.7 times more likely in Wales (72.3%), compared with households where all residents were aged 64 years and under (15.6% in England and 19.7% in Wales).

    Households where all residents (aged 16 years and over) were employed had the highest percentage that owned their accommodation with a mortgage, loan or shared ownership (47.3% in England and 48.8% in Wales), compared with other household employment combinations.

Tenure is whether a household rents or owns the accommodation that they occupy. Households that rented their accommodation were asked what type of landlord owned or managed it.

Tenure by household size

Households with fewer people were more likely to own their accommodation outright compared with larger household sizes. The largest percentage was among two person households (44.0% in England and 49.6% in Wales), followed by one person households (38.2% in England and 43.2% in Wales).

Households with three or more people were most likely to own their accommodation with a mortgage, loan or shared ownership. The largest percentage was found among four person households (53.6% in England and 54.5% in Wales).

Higher levels of rented accommodation were found among one person households and households with five or more people, compared with other household sizes. Households with six or more people had the largest percentages of social renting (26.0% in England and 26.9% in Wales) and private renting or living rent free (27.5% in England and 24.8% in Wales).

At a regional level in England:

    one and two person households were most likely to own their accommodation outright in all regions except London, where one person households had higher percentages of social rented accommodation (28.8%), and two person households had more that rented their accommodation privately or lived rent free (33.0%)

    the most common tenure of households with three or more people was owned with a mortgage, loan or shared ownership in all regions except London, where the most common tenure of three person households and households with six or more people was privately renting or living rent free

    the lowest percentages of households that owned their accommodation with a mortgage, loan or shared ownership were found among one person households across all English regions, with the lowest levels in the North East (15.9%)

Tenure by age

    We can compare tenure across age bands at the household level in two ways. First by analysing the household combination of resident age bands, and second by using the age of the household reference person (HRP), see Section 11: Glossary for a definition of HRP.

Household combination of resident age

    Households with some residents aged 16 to 64 years were the most likely to own their accommodation with a mortgage, loan or shared ownership, compared with other household age combinations. Households where residents aged 16 to 64 years lived with residents aged 15 years and under had the highest percentages (47.8% in England and 48.1% in Wales).

    In England, social rented accommodation was most common among households where residents aged 15 years and under lived with residents aged 65 years and over (25.8%). However, this category only made up 0.03% of all households in England. In Wales, social rented accommodation was most common among households where residents aged 15 years and under lived with residents aged 16 to 64 years (21.4%).

    Households who rented their accommodation privately or lived rent free were most likely to include younger residents. The highest percentages were in households where residents were all aged 16 to 64 years (27.8% in England and 22.7% in Wales) and households where residents aged 16 to 64 years lived with residents aged 15 years and under (25.0% in England and 22.4% in Wales).

    Households with some residents aged 65 years and over were 4.4 times more likely to own their accommodation outright in England (69.4%), and 3.7 times more likely in Wales (72.3%), compared with households where all residents were aged under 64 years (15.6% in England and 19.7% in Wales).

Age of the household reference person

When looking at the age of the HRP, households with a HRP aged:

    65 years and over, were the most likely to own their accommodation outright (71.0% in England and 73.3% in Wales)

    35 to 49 years, were the most likely to own their accommodation with a mortgage, loan or shared ownership (47.8% in England and 49.6% in Wales)

    16 to 34 years, had the highest percentages in the social rented sector (18.4% in England and 20.8% in Wales) and that rented their accommodation privately or lived rent free (46.4% in England and 40.9% in Wales)

Tenure by household family composition

Single family households where all residents were aged 66 years and over had the highest percentages that owned their accommodation outright (84.2% in England and 84.7% in Wales), compared with other household family compositions.

Single family couple households:

    were the most likely to own their accommodation with a mortgage, loan or shared ownership (47.4% in England and 46.6% in Wales), compared with other family compositions

    with dependent children, had a higher percentage that owned their accommodation with a mortgage, loan or shared ownership (58.8% in England and 60.4% in Wales), compared with those without

    with all non-dependent children, had a higher percentage that owned their accommodation outright (43.7% in England and 48.7% in Wales), compared with those with dependent or no children

"Other household types", such as those in full-time education (93.4% in England and 94.2% in Wales), were the most likely to rent their accommodation privately, compared with other family compositions.

Single family lone parent households had the highest percentages in the social rented sector (37.8% in England and 35.6% in Wales), compared with other household compositions. Those with dependent children had a higher percentage (42.0% in England and 40.5% in Wales), compared with those with all non-dependent children.

Tenure of multi-generational households

Multi-generational households made up 2.1% of households in England (500,410) and 2.0% of households in Wales (27,530).

Compared with households not classified as multi-generational (also referred to as "other households" in this section), multi-generational households had:

    slightly higher levels that owned their accommodation outright (1.3 percentage points higher in England and 4.4 higher in Wales)

    slightly higher levels that owned their accommodation with a mortgage, loan or shared ownership in England (0.5 percentage points higher)

    slightly lower levels that owned their accommodation with a mortgage, loan or shared ownership in Wales (0.7 percentage points lower)

    higher levels in the social rented sector (4.6 percentage points higher in England and 3.4 higher in Wales)

    lower levels of privately rented accommodation or living rent free (6.4 percentage points lower in England and 7.2 lower in Wales)

The largest differences between multi-generational and other households across English regions were in London. Compared with other households in London, multi-generational households had:

    higher levels of owned outright accommodation (4.2 percentage points)

    higher levels in social rented accommodation (8.0 percentage points)

    lower levels in privately rented accommodation or that lived rent free (12.0 percentage points)

Tenure by ethnic group

Households were classified by the ethnic groups household members identified with. For information about the two-stage process of the ethnic group question in Census 2021, see our Ethnic group by age and sex, England and Wales: Census 2021 article.

Households where all residents identified within the "White" high-level category were most likely to own their accommodation outright (35.9% in England and 39.3% in Wales).

Owned with a mortgage, loan or shared ownership was most common in households with three or more ethnic groups (47.5% in England and 46.3% in Wales) and households where all members identified within the "Asian, Asian British or Asian Welsh" high-level category (36.8% in England and 36.4% in Wales).

Privately rented accommodation or living rent free was most common among households where all members identified within the "Other" high-level category (41.7% in England and 51.9% in Wales).

Compared with other ethnic group combinations, households where all residents identified within the "Black, Black British, Black Welsh, Caribbean or African" high-level category had the:

    lowest percentages that owned their accommodation outright, being 3.7 times lower in England (8.9%) and 4.9 times lower in Wales (7.7%), compared with households in England (32.5%) and Wales (38.0%) overall

    lowest percentages that owned their accommodation with a mortgage, loan or shared ownership, being 1.6 times lower in England (18.8%) and 2.2 times lower in Wales (12.9%), compared with households in England (29.8%) and Wales (28.4%) overall

At a regional level in England:

    households where all residents identified within the "White" high-level category were most likely to own their accommodation outright in every region except London, where it was more common for their accommodation to be rented privately

    the lowest percentages of owned outright accommodation were among households where all members identified within the "Black, Black British, Black Welsh, Caribbean or African" high-level category in the North East (3.9%) and North West (6.7%)

    the highest percentages of social rented accommodation were in households where all residents identified within the "Black, Black British, Black Welsh, Caribbean or African" high-level category in every region, except for East of England and South East, where privately rented accommodation or living rent free was more common

Tenure by religion

Households were classified by the religious affiliation of household members who chose to answer the religion question.

In England, the percentage of households that owned their accommodation was highest among households where all residents who answered the religion question identified as “Sikh" (76.2%). When looking at owner-occupied categories, “Sikh only” households had the highest percentage that owned their accommodation with a mortgage, loan or shared ownership (45.2%). Households where all members who answered the religion question identified as “Christian” (44.3%) or “Jewish” (41.9%) had the highest percentages that owned their accommodation outright.

In Wales, when classifying households by residents who answered the religion question, households with a mix of residents who identified as “Christian” and “No religion” had the highest percentages that owned the accommodation they lived in (75.2%). The next highest levels were among “Christian only” households (74.9%). When looking at owner-occupied categories, “Christian only” (53.5%) and “Jewish only” (41.2%) households had the highest percentages that owned outright. The highest percentages of owning accommodation with a mortgage, loan or shared ownership were among “Sikh only” households (42.9%) and “Christian and No religion” households (40.7%).

Households where all residents who answered the religion question identified as "Muslim" had the:

    lowest percentages that owned their accommodation (41.5% in England and 37.6% in Wales)

The highest percentage of households that owned their accommodation was found in households with a mix of employed and economically inactive residents (66.6% in England and 72.6% in Wales), compared with other household employment status combinations. When looking at owner-occupied categories, households with some economically inactive residents had a higher percentage that owned their accommodation outright, and the highest levels were among households with all economically inactive residents (56.9% in England and 57.9% in Wales). In contrast, households with some employed residents had higher levels that owned their accommodation with a mortgage, loan or shared ownership, and the highest levels were among households with all employed residents (47.3% in England and 48.8% in Wales).

Households where all residents were unemployed had the highest percentages in the social rented sector (40.8% in England and 38.1% in Wales) and privately rented accommodation or living rent free (37.1% in England and 37.9% in Wales), compared with other household employment status combinations.

Among households with some residents aged 66 years and over:

    owned outright accommodation was the most common compared with other tenures, regardless of the employment status of those aged 66 years and over in the household

    households with a mix of working and not working residents aged 66 years and over had the highest levels of owned outright accommodation (77.4% in England and 79.3% in Wales)

Occupation of the household reference person

When looking at households with an employed household reference person (HRP), households in England and Wales with a HRP in:

    administrative or secretarial occupations (such as office managers and receptionists), skilled trade occupations (such as electricians and chefs) and professional occupations (such as doctors and teachers) were the most likely to own their accommodation outright (45.7%, 34.2% and 33.6%, respectively)
