Trends in living arrangements including families (with and without dependent children), people living alone and people in shared accommodation, broken down by size and type of household.

Main points

    In 2022, there were 19.4 million families in the UK, an increase of just over 1 million families (5.7%) in the decade since 2012.

    In 2022, 43% of families (8.3 million) had no children living within them, 42% had one or more dependent children (8.2 million) and 15% had only non-dependent children (2.9 million).

    Married or civil-partnered couple families accounted for the majority of families in 2022 (66%), while cohabiting-couple families accounted for almost 1 in 5 families (19%) and lone-parent families accounted for the remaining 15%.

    The majority of the 2.9 million lone-parent families in 2022 were headed by a lone mother (2.5 million, 84%), with lone fathers now accounting for 16% (457,000) of lone-parent families.

    There were an estimated 28.2 million households in the UK in 2022, an increase of 6.1% (1.6 million) since 2012; most (2 in 3) households consist of one family, either a couple family with or without children (57%) or a lone-parent family (10%).

    The number of people living alone in the UK in 2022 was 8.3 million, this represents 13% of the household population and 30% of all households; the majority (53%) of these households were women living alone.

Families

There were an estimated 19.4 million families in the UK in 2022; an increase of 5.7%, or just over 1 million more families than there were in 2012 (18.4 million families).

Married-couple families remain the most common type of family in 2022 (12.7 million), accounting for 65% of all families. Since 2012, the number of married-couple families has increased from 12.3 million, however this family type has been generally declining as a proportion of all families over time (67% in 2012).

"Opposite-sex cohabiting couple" was the fastest growing family type over the last 10 years. In 2022, these made up 18% of all families (3.6 million opposite-sex cohabiting couple families), an increase from 16% of all families (2.9 million) in 2012. This increase of almost 700,000 families accounted for almost three-quarters of the total growth in the number of families in the UK over the ten-year period.

There were 2.9 million lone-parent families in 2022, accounting for 15% of all families. This is not significantly different to 2012, when there were 3.0 million lone-parent families, equivalent to 17% of all families. While the majority of lone-parent families are lone-mother families (2.5 million, 84%), in 2022, 16% (457,000) were lone-father families. Lone-mother families are more likely to include one or more dependent children (66%) than lone-father families (48%).

Same-sex cohabiting couple families account for 0.6% and civil-partner couple families (both same sex and opposite sex) account for a further 0.6% of all families in 2022.

Families with no children made up the largest proportion (43%) of families (8.3 million) in 2022. Families with one or more dependent children made up 42% of families (8.2 million), while families with non-dependent children only made up 15%. Families with no children will include those who have not had children as well as those whose children live elsewhere.

Of all families with dependent children, families with one child made up 44% (3.6 million) in 2022. Families with two children made up 41% (3.4 million), and families with three or more children made up 15% (1.2 million).

While Census 2021 data for England and Wales is not directly comparable with the Labour Force Survey for the UK presented here, recently published analysis of Families in England and Wales: Census 2021 provides more detailed analysis of Families, such as lone parents, multi-generational households and children with a second parental address. 

Households

There were an estimated 28.2 million households in the UK in 2022; 6.1% or 1.6 million more households than there were in 2012 (26.6 million households).

The average household size remained similar over the last 10 years, with 2.36 residents per household in both 2012 and in 2022.

One-family households were the most common type of household, accounting for 2 in 3 UK households in 2022, (18.8 million households). This is a similar proportion to 2012 when one-family households accounted for 67% of UK households (17.8 million).

One-person households (those living alone) are the second most common type of household, accounting for almost 1 in 3 (30%) UK households in 2022, 8.3 million households. This is a similar proportion to 2012 when one-person households accounted for 29% of UK households (7.7 million households). One-person households were estimated to be a greater proportion of all households in Scotland (36%) in 2022 than in England or Wales (both 30%) and the English region with the highest proportion of one-person households was the North East (34%).

Households formed of unrelated adults accounted for 3% of all UK households in both 2012 and 2022, while multi-family households made up 1% of all UK households in both years.

Living alone

In 2022, the number of people living alone in the UK was 8.3 million, 13% of the people who live in households. There were 4.4 million women living alone (53% of the total) compared with 3.9 million men; however, the number of men living alone has grown by more than the number of women living alone over the last decade (0.4 million more men compared with 0.2 million more women).

The age distribution of those living alone has been increasing over time for both men and women. Since 2020, half of those living alone have been aged 65 years and over (51% in 2022). A decade earlier in 2012, 45% of those living alone were in this age group. In 2022, more than 1 in 5 men and 1 in 3 women living alone were aged 75 years or over.

While women account for the majority of those living alone age 65 years and over (64%), this proportion has been reducing over time (69% in 2012). This reflects the greater increases in male life expectancy seen in recent years, as more men are living alone at older ages.
