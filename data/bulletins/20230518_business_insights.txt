Headline figures

The data presented in this bulletin are the results from Wave 82 of the Business Insights and Conditions Survey (BICS), which was live from 2 to 14 May 2023.

The data reported within BICS bulletins and datasets are estimates that are subject to uncertainty, such as sampling variability and non-sampling error. Further information on quality is available in our Business Insights and Conditions Survey Quality and Methodology Information (QMI) report, and we regularly update the confidence intervals associated with the survey questions.

Experimental single-site weighted regional estimates up to Wave 74 are available in our Business insights and impact on the UK subnational single-site economy: February 2023 article.

Please note that businesses were asked to exclude seasonal changes when answering questions contained within BICS.

The percentage of businesses that reported they were trading was 95% in early May 2023, with 87% fully trading and 9% partially trading (for example, trading with reduced hours or staff numbers). Meanwhile, 3% of businesses reported "temporarily paused trading" and 2% "permanently ceased trading" as their business's trading status.
