Main points

    Public sector net borrowing (PSNB ex) in April 2023 was £25.6 billion, £11.9 billion more than in April 2022 and the second-highest April borrowing since monthly records began in 1993, with the growth in receipts being exceeded by the additional costs of the energy support schemes, increases in benefit payments and higher debt interest payable.

    Central government debt interest payable was £9.8 billion in April 2023, £3.1 billion more than April 2022 and the highest April figure since monthly records began in 1997; the recent large movements in interest payable are because of the effect of Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation on index-linked gilts.

    Since our March 2023 publication, we have revised down our initial estimate of PSNB ex in the financial year ending (FYE) March 2023 by £2.1 billion to £137.1 billion, now £15.3 billion less than the £152.4 billion forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).

    Public sector net debt (PSND ex) at the end of April 2023 was £2,536.9 billion or around 99.2% of gross domestic product (GDP), with the debt-to-GDP ratio at levels last seen in the early 1960s; excluding the Bank of England, debt was £2,273.6 billion or around 88.9% of GDP, £263.2 billion lower than the wider measure.

    Public sector net worth (PSNW ex) was a deficit of £611.8 billion at the end of April 2023.

    Central government net cash requirement (excluding UK Asset Resolution Ltd and Network Rail) was £18.8 billion in April 2023, £5.6 billion below the OBR expectation; the total for the FYE March 2023 remains at £111.3 billion, £4.1 billion less than the £115.4 billion forecast by the OBR.

The initial outturn estimates for the early months of the financial year, particularly April, contain more forecast data than other months, as profiles of tax receipts, and departmental and local government spending are still provisional. The data for these months are typically more prone to sizeable revisions in later months.

Borrowing in April 2023

    Initial estimates for April 2023 show that the public sector spent more than it received in taxes and other income, requiring it to borrow £25.6 billion. This was £11.9 billion more than that borrowed in April 2022 and the second highest April borrowing since monthly records began in 1993, behind April 2020.

    Public sector borrowing consists of two broad components: the current budget deficit and capital expenditure (or net investment).

    In April 2023, the public sector current budget deficit (or borrowing to fund day-to-day activities) was £19.4 billion, £10.1 billion more than in April 2022. Over the same period, public sector net investment increased by £1.8 billion to £6.2 billion.

    Central government forms the largest part of the public sector and the relationship between its receipts and expenditure is the main determinant of public sector borrowing.

    A breakdown of net borrowing by sub-sector and a summary of central government receipts and expenditure data are presented in Tables 1 to 3 in our Public sector finances summary tables: Appendix M.

    A further detailed breakdown of public sector income is presented in our Public sector current receipts: Appendix D.

    While central government’s receipts fell by £2.7 billion to £69.7 billion compared with April 2022, its total expenditure grew by £22.0 billion to £109.0 billion.

    Compulsory social contributions fell by £1.3 billion to £12.9 billion compared with April 2022. This was largely because a temporary higher rate for the Health and Social Care Levy was introduced in April 2022 and later removed from 6 November 2022. Combined, central government tax receipts and compulsory social contributions were broadly flat compared with April last year.

    Payments to and from central government and the Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility Fund cause a £3.2 billion fall in receipts and £9.8 billion extra capital expenditure, however the effect is neutral for public sector borrowing overall. We explain these transactions, along with other notable areas of April’s expenditure, in this section.

Interest payable on central government debt

    In April 2023, the interest payable on central government debt was £9.8 billion, £3.1 billion more than in April 2022, as rises in the Retail Prices Index have increased the interest payable on index-linked gilts. This represents the third-highest interest payable in any month on record, behind the £20.0 billion in June 2022 and the £18.0 billion in December 2022.

Energy support payments

    In April 2023, central government spent £3.9 billion on subsidies, £1.8 billion more than in the April 2022. This growth was largely because of the cost of the Energy Price Guarantee for households and the Energy Bills Discount Scheme, which replaced the Energy Bill Relief Scheme for businesses across the UK from April 2023.
    Other current grants

    Central government paid £1.8 billion in “other current grants” in April 2023, £3.4 billion less than in April 2022. This fall was largely because of the £3.2 billion cost-of-living council tax rebate payments to households in England and Wales in April 2022.

Net social benefits

    Net social benefits paid by central government in April 2023 were £25.4 billion, £4.5 billion more than in April 2022. This increase was in part because of inflation linked benefits uprating, along with the £2.2 billion Department for Work and Pensions (DWP): Means tested benefits cost-of-living payments, recorded this month.

Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility Fund

    Between January 2013 and July 2022, HM Treasury received regular payments from the Bank of England Asset Purchase Facility Fund (APF) under the indemnity agreement. These payments have now stopped. As a result, central government interest and dividend receipts in April 2023 were estimated to be £1.0 billion, a reduction of £2.8 billion compared with April 2022.

    This month the APF received its third payment from HM Treasury under the indemnity agreement. This £9.8 billion of central government expenditure has been recorded as a capital transfer to the Bank of England, a component of net investment.

    As with other such payments, intra-public sector transfers are public sector net borrowing neutral. However, these central government transactions will impact our public sector net borrowing excluding the Bank of England (PSNB ex BoE) measure.

Borrowing in the financial year ending March 2023

    Since our Public sector finances, UK: March 2023 bulletin published on 25 April 2023, we have reduced our initial estimate of borrowing for the 12 months to March 2023 by £2.1 billion, to £137.1 billion.

    This was £16.1 billion more borrowing than in the financial year ending (FYE) 2022. It remains the fourth-highest FYE borrowing since monthly records began, behind FYE 2021 (during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic) and both the FYE 2010 and FYE 2011 (after the effects of the global financial downturn).
