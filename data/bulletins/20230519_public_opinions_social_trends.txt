GP practice access

In the latest period, we asked adults about their experiences of accessing a GP practice.

Around half (49%) of adults reported trying to contact a GP practice for themselves or someone else in the past month.

Of these adults:

    around 7 in 10 (68%) reported they had managed to make contact on the same day they tried (had received a response from a receptionist or clinician or been able to book an appointment)

    8% reported they had made contact on the day after

    15% reported they had made contact two or more days later

    10% reported they didn't manage to make contact with the GP practice

Around 4 in 10 (40%) of these adults reported it was easy or very easy to contact the GP practice, whereas 36% reported that it was difficult or very difficult.  

Around 6 in 10 (60%) of these adults described their overall experience of the GP practice as very or fairly good, and 22% reported that it was very or fairly poor.

More information about the methods people contacted their GP practice by and any next steps they took after making contact is available in the GP practice access dataset.

A more detailed looked at people's experience of GP practice access is included in our Impact of winter pressures on different population groups in Great Britain article. You can also explore estimates of how people feel about their GP practice experience in England using estimates from the GP patient survey.
